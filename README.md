# Messenger

Team:
* Me,
* Myself &
* I

Notes:
* Could not find a team, so here I am sad, tired and stupid all alone.
* However, I still tried to understand all Git features and used them as possible.
* After researching start think that all it was easier to pull of with TCP, but I don't think we suppose to use it.
* Then I tried to create chat with using arrays for containing users information (like logins, passwords). I couldn't, so I decided to use maps and vectors.
* For some reasons the project didn't work after dividing into '.h' and '.cpp' files, so I decided to make it a single file project. Will think about what is wrong later.

Plans:
* Add function for creating nicknames.
* Make external container for users information, so it could still exist after closing app.
* Add protection for  all this'strings'.
* Create actual function "@all messages", not just group chats.
