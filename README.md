# Messenger

Team:
* Me,
* Myself &
* I

Notes:
* Could not find a team, so here I am sad, tired and stupid all alone
* After researching start think that all it was easier to pull of with TCP, but I don't think we suppose to use it
* Then I tried to create chat with using arrays for containing users information (like logins, passwords). I couldn't, so I decided to use maps and vectors.
